<h1>Chezy Champs Code Proposal</h1>
<h2>Deploy Speed</h2>
The current deploy speed is more than 15 seconds. This should be brought down to less than a second.
<h2>Code Base</h2>
Should be object oriented, and have consistent formatting for easy debugging.
<h2>Notes</h2>
Boris had the idea of having all the constants in a text file on the rio. That way, the code doesn't need to be recompiled everytime a constant is changed.
